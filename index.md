## Experience
#### Intern , Ederlabs  (January 2020-Present)
Currently working on **Differential Privacy**. 
<br/>
Worked on privacy preserving machine learning using Trusted Execution Environment(TEE) **Intel SGX**. 

#### Freelance Web Developer  (July-October 2018)
Worked on two frontend projects for two clients using **AngularJS** and **Bootstrap4**. 
<br/>
<br/>
## Open Source Contributions

#### PySyft
"A library for answering questions using data you cannot see"
<br/>
A framework for privacy-preserving deep learning using Pytorch and Tensorflow.

I worked on **Pytorch** development.
Part of the Core team
Contributed to Core PySyft Team

#### Deepgaze
Computer Vision library for human-computer interaction in **Python**
<br/>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I have refactored certain parts of the library for improved usability and wrote test cases to ensure accurate functionality. Ported library to Python 3.0.

## Some Projects I am proud of

For complete list of projects feel free to check my [Github Profile](https://github.com/kamathhrishi).

**Indoor Scene Recognition**
<br/>
- Trained a 8 layer Convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch using **Pytorch** in **Python** to recognize 67 different indoor scene categories from just 5400 images. 
- Read classical "CNN for Computer Vision" papers and explored various architectures.

**Exploratory Analysis of Amazon Unlocked Mobile Reviews**
<br/>
Analyzed a dataset of 400,000 reviews for relationship between brands ,pricing and ratings using **Seaborn** and **Pandas** in **Python**.

**Indoor Scene Recognition**
<br/>
Supervised Learning
<br/>
- Trained a 30 layer Residual CNN from scratch which could predict 50 different species of animals with 72% accuracy
- Finetuned a ImageNet pretrained 18 layer network to attain 89% accuracy 
<br/>
<br/>
Zero Shot Learning
<br/>
<br/>
- Currently exploring Zero shot learning on the dataset. A naive implementation with Direct Attribute prediction attains 35% accuracy prediction unseen classes.
